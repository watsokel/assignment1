### About Me

My name is Kelvin Watson and I live in Portland, Oregon. I was born and raised in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. I completed my previous degree at the University of British Columbia (UBC) in Vancouver, Canada in 2007. Prior to obtaining my B.Sc(Pharm.), I completed third year in the Microbiology and Immunology program, also at UBC. As such, my educational background has mostly been in the life and health sciences. After graduation, I practiced as a hospital pharmacist for almost 7 years. In 2013, I left my pharmacist position, and am currently in my third quarter of the 1.25-year track of the post-baccalaureate Bachelor of Science in Computer Science at Oregon State University. I am currently taking CS 261, CS 271, CS 290 and CS 340.

In the future, I hope to combine my background in the life sciences and healthcare with computer science and work in areas such as artificial intelligence, cognitive systems, computational drug discovery, machine learning, healthcare informatics and software development.
